%% The following code sets up the document formatting

%this assumes that res_yy.sty is in some path
\documentstyle[hyperref, margin, line, multicol]{res_yy}

\hypersetup{backref,pdfpagemode=Full,colorlinks=true,backref}

\addtolength{\oddsidemargin}{-0.45in}
\addtolength{\voffset}{-0.30in}
\addtolength{\textwidth}{1.00in} \addtolength{\textheight}{1.50in}

\renewcommand{\namefont}{\LARGE\emph}



%%
%% The following code defines some macros for terms which have raised font
%% (ie 4\fourth would result 4th with the 'th' raised (superscripted)
%%

\def\Cplusplus{{\rm C\raise.5ex\hbox{\small ++}}}
\def\CSharp{{\rm C\raise.5ex\hbox{\small \#}}}
% 'st' 'nd' 'rd' 'th' superscripts for numbers
